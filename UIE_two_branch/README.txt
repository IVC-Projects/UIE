the output images generated by our proposed method are stored in the folder "XXXX_output_XXXX"
the checkpoint of our proposed measure is stored in the folder "XXXX_CHECKPOINT_XXXX"
the ground truth images are stored in the folder "test_groundtruth_XXXX".

#1. Test images with reference images: test_images_pair_XXXX.
    # The output images will be stored in the same folder, and named “xx_out.png”.
    # To test these images, you need to move these output images to an another folder (test_output_FINAL),
    # and run the python file "Measure_PSNR_SSIM_UIQM/measure_test.py",
    # the mean value of PSNR、SSIM and UIQM will be calculated.

#2. Test images without reference images: test_images_unpair.
    # The measure is same to #1.

#3. To test images, you need to check the checkpoint_dir in main_test_drcan.py(Line 20)
    # and the filenames and data_dir in main_test_drcan.py(Line 35/36)
    # Also, the network is need to be noticed,
    # and check if the network is the same as the network when training the model
